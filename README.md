### Parasitic Cell Image Prediction Using CNN and VGG16


##### Introduction

Parasitic infections are a significant global health concern, particularly in underdeveloped regions. Early detection plays a crucial role in mitigating the spread of these infections. This project uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and the **VGG16 architecture** to classify and predict parasitic cell infections from microscopic images.

##### Key Feature

- Uses **transfer learning** with the VGG16 architecture.
- Classifies images into parasitic and non-parasitic cells.
- Provides high accuracy with a robust and scalable model.

##### Technologies Used

- Python
- Tensorflow/keras
- Matplotlib

##### Dataset

- The dataset consists of microscopic images of parasitic and non-parasitic cells.
- Stucture
- `Parasitic`: Images of cells infected by parasites.
- `Non-Parasitic`: Healthy cell images.
